Question: Title of the paper
Response: The title of the paper is "Characterization of poxtA, a novel phenicol–oxazolidinone–tetracycline resistance gene from an MRSA of clinical origin."

Question: How potxA confer linezolid resistance ?
Response: The poxtA gene encodes a protein of the ARE ABC-F family, which is distantly related to OptrA and can confer reduced susceptibility to phenicols, oxazolidinones, and tetracyclines. It contributes to the resistance phenotype of the MRSA strain by providing resistance to these antibiotics.

Question: Explain in detail how ARE ABC-F family protein work to remove antibiotics ? If you don't know, say don know
Response: The ARE ABC-F family proteins mediate antibiotic resistance through ribosomal protection. These proteins contain two conserved nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) separated by a linker region. They do not have transmembrane domains. The mechanism of resistance involves binding to the ribosome and preventing the antibiotic from inhibiting protein synthesis. This mechanism allows the bacteria to continue growing and surviving in the presence of antibiotics. The proteins can confer resistance to various classes of antibiotics, including tetracyclines, macrolides, ketolides, lincosamides, phenicols, pleuromutilins, oxazolidinones, and streptogramins. The exact process by which these proteins mediate resistance has been debated, but recent research has clarified that it is through ribosomal protection. This mechanism allows the bacteria to evade the effects of antibiotics and continue to thrive.

Question: comparison between optrA and potxA
Response: The poxtA gene encodes a protein that is 32% identical to OptrA and exhibits structural features typical of the F lineage of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein superfamily that cause antibiotic resistance by ribosomal protection. Both genes belong to the ARE ABC-F family of proteins and confer resistance to phenicols, oxazolidinones, and tetracyclines. While OptrA has been previously described, PoxtA is a newly identified resistance determinant with a broad spectrum of activity against these antibiotic classes.

Question: Spectrum of potxA vs optrA
Response: The poxtA gene, a novel resistance determinant, belongs to the ARE ABC-F family of proteins and confers reduced susceptibility to phenicols, oxazolidinones, and tetracyclines. It carries two recognizable NBDs and lacks TMDs and a signal peptide. On the other hand, OptrA, another member of the ARE ABC-F family, confers resistance to phenicols and oxazolidinones through ribosomal protection. PoxtA shows a broader spectrum of activity, as it can also confer resistance to tetracyclines, which is not observed in other members of the ARE ABC-F family.

Question: Reduced susceptibility vs resistance ?
Response: The poxtA gene confers reduced susceptibility to phenicols, oxazolidinones, and tetracyclines in various bacterial strains, including E. coli, S. aureus, and E. faecalis. This means that the presence of the poxtA gene makes these bacteria less sensitive to these antibiotics, but it does not necessarily confer full resistance.

Question: Reduced susceptibility vs resistance experiment in the paper ?
Response: The experiment in the paper focused on investigating the antimicrobial susceptibilities of S. aureus, E. faecalis, and E. coli strains carrying a cloned copy of the poxtA gene. The results showed that expression of the poxtA gene in these strains was associated with decreased susceptibility to phenicols, oxazolidinones, and tetracyclines. This decreased susceptibility indicates a reduced susceptibility to these antibiotics rather than full resistance.

Question: Reduced susceptibility vs resistance experiment in the paper with detail data ?
Response: In the experiment detailed in the paper, the expression of the poxtA gene in S. aureus, E. faecalis, and E. coli strains resulted in decreased susceptibility to phenicols (chloramphenicol and florfenicol), oxazolidinones (linezolid and tedizolid), and tetracyclines (tetracycline and doxycycline). The MIC values for these antibiotics were higher in strains carrying the poxtA gene compared to those with the empty vector. Additionally, the expression of poxtA in E. coli also led to decreased susceptibility to tigecycline. The study did not find differences in susceptibility to other antibiotics tested.

Question: Reduced susceptibility vs resistance experiment in the paper with detail data and MIC value ?
Response: In the experiment conducted in the paper, the antimicrobial susceptibilities of S. aureus, E. faecalis, and E. coli strains carrying a cloned copy of the poxtA gene were investigated. The MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) values for various antibiotics were measured and compared between strains carrying the poxtA gene and those carrying an empty plasmid vector. 

For example, in S. aureus strain RN4220, the MIC values for linezolid were 2 mg/L with poxtA and 1 mg/L with the empty vector. In E. faecalis strain JH2-2, the MIC values for linezolid were 4 mg/L with poxtA and 1 mg/L with the empty vector. In E. coli strain Mach1 T1 R, the MIC values for linezolid were 1024 mg/L with poxtA and 256 mg/L with the empty vector.

Similar comparisons were made for other antibiotics such as tedizolid, chloramphenicol, florfenicol, tigecycline, tetracycline, and doxycycline. The results showed that expression of the poxtA gene was associated with decreased susceptibility to these antibiotics in all three strains.

These findings indicate that the poxtA gene confers reduced susceptibility to phenicols, oxazolidinones, and tetracyclines in the tested bacterial strains.
