Question: Summary how they achieve better plasmid assembly by Bandage ?
Response: The study achieved better plasmid assembly using Bandage by confirming circularization of mcr-1-harboring plasmid contigs. For single contigs that were not circularizable, Bandage was used to visualize the sequencing assembly graph generated by SPAdes and manually resolve the most likely mcr-1 plasmid structures based on node linkage and contig coverage.

Question: Please explain in more detail ?
Response: The study conducted in Guangzhou, China, focused on the increasing prevalence of mcr-1–positive multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in human fecal samples. The research identified various plasmid families, such as IncI, IncHI2/HI2A, and IncX4, that play a role in the spread of mcr-1. These plasmids are known to carry genes conferring resistance to antibiotics, including colistin. The study highlighted the rapid emergence of these plasmids in multidrug-resistant E. coli strains found in humans, indicating a significant level of genetic variability and adaptability in these bacteria over a short period of time.

Question: Explain in more deatail how they achieve better plasmid assembly by Bandage ?
Response: The study used Bandage to confirm the circularization of mcr-1–harboring plasmid contigs. For single mcr-1–harboring plasmid contigs that were not circularizable, Bandage was used to visualize the sequencing assembly graph generated by SPAdes. Researchers then manually resolved the most likely mcr-1 plasmid structures based on node (contig) linkage and contig coverage. This approach helped in achieving better plasmid assembly by providing a visual representation of the assembly graph and aiding in the manual resolution of the plasmid structures.

Question: Is the method reliable ?
Response: The method used in the study involved collecting fecal samples, culturing Enterobacteriaceae isolates, and screening for mcr-1 by PCR. While the method was thorough and detailed, it may have underestimated true mcr-1 colonization by not performing PCR directly on DNA extracts from whole feces. Additionally, the study focused on culturable, cefotaxime- and colistin-resistant isolates, which may have limited the overall diversity of strains and mobile genetic elements harboring mcr-1.

Question: Summary their bioinformatic analysis
Response: The bioinformatic analysis in the study involved whole-genome sequencing of cefotaxime-resistant, mcr-1–positive Enterobacteriaceae isolates. DNA was extracted and sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform. Species identification was done using Kraken and read-data were mapped to species-specific references. Hybrid de novo assemblies were generated using SPAdes, and in silico multilocus sequence typing was performed. Resistance genes were identified from de novo assemblies using a curated database of resistance genes. The phylogeny was reconstructed using IQtree and corrected for recombination using ClonalFrameML. Insertion sequences were queried against the ISFinder database. Circularization of mcr-1–harboring plasmid contigs was confirmed using Bandage. Sequence data have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information.
